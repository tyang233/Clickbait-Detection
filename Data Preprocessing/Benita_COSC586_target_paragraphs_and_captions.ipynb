      "I felt like I looked kind of dead and tired (this pic might say otherwise because I took it in the morning; regardless I really hate this picture and all the other thousands I took before it). I really felt tempted to just say “fuck it” and put on some eyeliner and mascara, because my eyes looked weird to me, being so bare. It’s interesting: I feel I’m one of those people who, depending on how I do my makeup or wear my hair, can look very different. (Sometimes friends see pictures of me and go, “Is that you?”) Now, taking away mascara, which is one of my constants, I feel I have more variations in my physical appearance that I’m not familiar with. It’s not a good or bad thing — feeling like you can look so different from day to day — it’s just a bit weird.\n",
      "Emotionally, the challenge was a good exercise in putting vanity in perspective. Maybe I’m lucky to work with people and have friends who literally don’t give a fuck what I look like. Or maybe they just don’t see me any differently from when I look dolled up to when I look natural. Either way, it’s good to know that what I put on my face won’t drastically change the world around me. It might change what I feel within, and it’s good to know now that I’m in control of that.\n",

That was another thing a lot of the women we talked to were really frustrated by, when a guy says, “Hey, let’s hang out sometime!” Well, what the fuck does that mean? Are we hanging out and boning? Or hanging out and running errands? I don’t know! I think it’s something that’s very frustrating, and I think it’s so annoying.

And the third guy’s in your mind the most because you’re like, “Why the fuck hasn’t this guy written back? What’s going on with him?” So he has an increasing presence in your mind, and that can lead to feelings of attraction, just having that presence there. It’s annoying that that stuff works, but it kind of does. Other times, though, it goes too far, and then you just get pissed off at the person who hasn’t written you back, or who just takes too long. It’s kind of weird finding that middle ground, but a little bit of that stuff does work; it’s just the way our minds work. We want what we can’t have.
