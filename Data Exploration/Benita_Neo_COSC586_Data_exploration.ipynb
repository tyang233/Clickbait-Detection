Tickets for the Magic Kingdom were increased 6 percent this year, to $105 plus tax, while entrance to other Orlando parks — Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Universal Studios — can’t be bought for less than $90.', 'Those costs have in recent years helped shunt tourists to smaller regional parks — but many of those have raised prices as well. Six Flags, which runs 800 rides across 18 North American parks, increased prices last spring and now charges $62 at its Maryland park. At American theme parks, per-person spending has climbed 33 percent since 2008, to about $56.23, data from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions show.', 'Park watchers have worried that the rising costs are blocking out wishful visitors, especially because a third of the Americans visiting the country’s theme parks are younger than 18, data from industry researcher IBISWorld show.

If anything, Disney is experimenting with how to persuade parkgoers to pay even more.

The “Magical Express,” a free shuttle from the airport into the sprawling park’s center, also shepherds tourists past the rental cars and rival attractions that would allow them to spend more time and money outside its gates.', 'The fun-per-hour value of the experience is still high, Disney executives say, because a tourist can spend all day there (as opposed to, say, a blockbuster movie). They add that higher gate prices have helped Disney invest in new, better attractions.', 'Disney World last year spent $425\\xa0million to expand Fantasyland, marked by the opening of a new Seven Dwarfs Mine Train roller coaster. Next spring at Epcot, Disney will retool its Norwegian-mythology flume ride, Maelstrom, into Frozen Ever After, where visitors will float past a skating Olaf and Elsa in an ice castle, singing “Let It Go” amid a sparkling, simulated snow.', 'But much of the recent innovation in the theme-park industry, experts said, has gone toward retooling it as a playground for the rich and their kids. The industry has increasingly “stratified its offerings,” said Sanders, Disney’s former pricing -executive, by offering more to attract visitors like “the ‘Wall Street dads,’ who have the obligation to bring the kids to Disney but want to do it as quickly as they can and are least sensitive to pricing of anyone.”', 'Parks now offer a variety of special upgrades aimed at the vacationing 1\\xa0percent, including after-hours parties, dine-with-princess events and guided tours such as SeaWorld Orlando’s “Private Elite VIP tour,” which bumps buyers to the fronts of lines and allows them to feed dolphins, sea lions and rays.', 'Disney’s two Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutiques sell a $195 pampering for little girls that includes a makeover, hair-styling, a costume and a princess sash.', 'The luxury has found its way back to the hotel room, as well.

As college students who are engaged in a myriad of social, economic, and political issues, it\\'s our duty to be actively engaged and educated about issues of sexism, racism and prejudice. While, respectfully, your daughter might not quite know what\\'s considered \"sexist\" yet, I can say with confidence that most college students can distinguish the boundaries of what\\'s considered appropriately sexist or not.', 'But, I\\'d like to refocus the conversation to the state of comedy that you feel like we would call \"racist\" or \"sexist.\"', 'We need to talk about the role that provocative comedy holds today in a progressive world.', \"It isn't so much that college students are too politically correct (whatever your definition of that concept is), it's that comedy in our progressive society today can no longer afford to be crass, or provocative for the sake of being offensive. Sexist humor and racist humor can no longer exist in comedy because these concepts are based on archaic ideals that have perpetrated injustice against minorities in the past.\", 'Provocative humor, such as ones dealing with topics of race and gender politics, can be crass and vulgar, but underlying it must be a context that spurs social dialogue about these respective issues. There needs to be a message, a central truth behind comedy for it to work as humor.', 'Take Amy Schumer for example.', \"A rising comic in her own right, Schumer has become a muse in being able to tackle difficult social commentaries of sexism and racism through her comedy.

One of the players asks the coach, \"What if she thinks it\\'s rape, but I don\\'t?\" Another player asks, \"What if my mom is the district attorney and won\\'t prosecute me? Can I rape?\"', 'Underlying the joke of it all, of course, is the horrifying truth of rape culture existent in high school football, and an even more horrifying reality of the parents attempting to justify it.

As countless comedians have proven before, it's very possible to have a message and be hilarious at the same time.\", 'This translates to stand-up comedy as well. Take it from your fellow male comics.', 'Stand-up comedian, Louis C.K\\'s bit about how much he loves being white can be, at first glance, construed as being \"racist\" in a traditional sense.

But, view it within the context of what he says, Louis C.K. constructs another valuable dialogue about white male privilege, and the historic injustices that this system has created.', 'A bit that could have been potentially disastrous was made even more hilarious because of the underlying social context of what Louis was saying.', 'George Carlin, who was revered by many as being one of the comedy \"greats,\" frequently used crass, vulgar and potentially offensive humor in his acts. While by today\\'s standards, some of Carlin\\'s material can be considered sexist and offensive, many of his bits are still appreciated today because of his strong opinions and the underlying context of what he said. Sure, he was offensive when he tried to justify using racial slurs, but as he said a bit, \"it\\'s the context that counts. It\\'s the user. It\\'s the intention behind the words that make them good or bad.\"', 'Stand-up comedian Todd Glass argued passionately on comedy podcast Sklarbro County, that young comedians who shy away from offensive humor lack the courage to use the medium as a way to create social commentary and dialogue, as Carlin did. Glass called for comedians to be more offensive, but within the right context.', \"You can be crass, you can be vulgar, and it's not about worrying about offending people. Fuck offending people. Offend the right fucking people. Don't let this fake argument that makes you not want to grow [as a comedian] and say, 'Oh, you're always going offend somebody.' No one said you shouldn't! It's your fake argument! Offend the living fuck out of people! But make sure you're doing it to the right group. Because, I'm sure George Carlin, most of the time, was offending the right people.\", \"So, yes, Mr. Seinfeld, we college students are politically correct. We will call out sexism and racism if we hear it. But if you're going to come to my college and perform in front of me, be prepared to write up a set that doesn't just offend me, but has something to say.\", \"There's no reason you can't do what other comics are doing. You have an amazing legacy, both in stand-up and on television, because you do your job well.\", \"But, there's a generation in college right now that hasn't seen your comedy, and there's a demographic that yearns for laughter. College students today are looking to be provoked, to be offended by comedy, and to think about these issues within the context of comedy.\", 'So please, take the first step and come to a college campus with a set that will make us laugh.', \"Offend the fuck out of college students.

Bush’s schedule for the past five months has been dominated by high-priced fundraisers for the super PAC, helping the group stockpile tens of millions.', 'Bush, once considered the GOP’s most formidable presidential contender, has revamped his campaign organization amid middling poll numbers and strong competition from other candidates. He is spending this week in Europe, bolstering his foreign policy bonafides, before officially announcing his campaign in Miami on Monday.', 'While his aides never publicly declared that the super PAC would hit $100 million, they did little to tamp down such predictions — and in some cases privately fueled them, according to top GOP fundraisers.', 'Mike Murphy, the strategist overseeing the super PAC, declined to comment, except to say: “At the right time, we will release very formidable numbers.”', 'It is possible that Bush will approach the $100 million figure if his campaign includes the entire sprawling political apparatus that he and his allies have built since January. By the end of the month, that operation will include a super PAC, a leadership PAC, a nonprofit and the soon-to-be announced campaign.', 'The super PAC may also have substantial pledges from wealthy donors who plan to expand on their initial contributions after this quarter, which ends June 30. In its early months of fundraising, the group was so awash in cash that it temporarily capped donations at $1 million.', 'The fundraising haul that the super PAC will report on July 15 is still bound to be historic. Bush told donors in April that the operation had raised more money in its first 100 days than any other Republican organization in modern history.', 'But any figure short of $100\\xa0million will probably be seen as a sign of weakness by senior party strategists and donors, many of whom now expect the group to greatly exceed that total.', '“I will be shocked if it is not $100 million or more,” said one veteran bundler raising money for Bush, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations about the fundraising.', 'The built-up expectations underscore the dramatically inflated atmosphere of this year’s money race.', 'When Bush’s brother George W. Bush launched his first presidential bid in 1999, he stunned the field by raising a record $37\\xa0million in four months. But that was before the advent of super PACs, which can accept unlimited sums from individuals and corporations.', 'The early, prominent role being played by those independent groups this year gives candidates with just a few wealthy backers the ability to compete. A network of super PACs supporting Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) claims to have raised $37 million so far, while super PACs backing Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are believed to be bringing in millions.', 'But it has been Bush, more than any other White House contender, who has put a heavy emphasis on raising big money before announcing his candidacy. His team laid out presidential-style goals for fundraisers, asking them to hit targets of $50,000, $100,000, $250,000 or $500,000 by April 17. Tickets to some high-priced events were $100,000 a person.', 'That fueled perceptions that the super PAC will post an eye-popping figure in its first report. Bush aides have done little to push back against such speculation, and there has been no evidence of a last-minute scramble to pack in late fundraisers for the group.', 'Instead, in recent days Bush’s team has turned its focus to raising money for his presidential campaign committee, which can accept donations only up to $2,700. The new goal for fundraisers: to bring in $27,000 during the last 15 days of the month.'], 'targetCaptions': ['Former Florida governor and expected Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush attended an economic conference in Berlin on Tuesday.

I also was with the team and John Stiner at the altitude camp he spoke about in Park City, and believe his report as well.”', 'In the BBC Panorama documentary Kara Goucher alleged Salazar had coached Rupp to get a therapeutic use exemption for an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships. Under Wada rules, such drips are prohibited and anyone caught manipulating the TUE process to get one would be liable for a ban. She also claimed Salazar tried to get her to take prescription thyroid medicine to lose weight after the birth of her son.', 'Stiner was the masseur who alleged he saw a bottle of Androgel, a testosterone gel, in Salazar’s training camp in Park City in 2008. And it was Magness who made the most serious allegation of all, telling Panorama he had documented evidence that Salazar had given the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16.', '“I have never met Steve but from all accounts believe him to be an honest individual. I firmly believe that any and all performance-enhancing drugs activity within the NOP while I was there was limited to Galen Rupp,” Rohatinsky said.', 'Among the charges against Salazar are that he gave the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16, coached Rupp to get a TUE so he could use an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships and flouted several other doping rules. Salazar and Rupp deny all charges and there is no suggestion that Farah has done anything wrong.', 'According to the American news website ProPublica, at least 17 people who have worked with Salazar have now spoken out against him. Rohatinsky, the latest person to come forward, said he had become particularly suspicious seeing Rupp win a 10,000m silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics behind Farah.', '“Watching that race live was surreal,” he said. “Seeing someone I had trained with consistently for two years not too long before – and beaten several times in races in the years prior to that in college – push through that last lap and accelerate on the homestretch to beat the likes of the Bekele brothers was incredible. And when I say incredible I mean it in the literal sense of the word. How does that amount of progress happen in that short a time frame? Supporters always point to hard work but we all worked our butts off. It reminds me of the Lance Armstrong commercial, What Am I On?', '“The entire time I was with the group there was always what I would call a wall of separation between Alberto/Galen and the rest of the group. Galen was very much Alberto’s son while the rest of the group were his athletes. In saying this I will give credit to Alberto, he worked his butt off for all of us and was very dedicated to taking care of the needs of everyone in the group. But that wall was always there and the level of secrecy and seclusion was definitely palpable.”', 'Meanwhile tThe chair of UK Athletics Ed Warner has told the BBC’s Sportsweek that his organisation had spoken to Farah “very frequently” over the past week and had no fears that he would return to top form later in the summer. “All things considered I think he’s in a good frame of mind in difficult circumstances,” he said. “He is going to get out there and show the great athlete he is in the summer, I am convinced of that.”', 'But Lord Coe, who is running for the presidency of the IAAF, global athletics’ governing body, agreed it had “not been a good period” for the sport. He also admitted he would “probably not” sever ties with Salazar if he was in Farah’s shoes.', '“If Mo is satisfied that there’s nothing to answer then he will want to keep what has been an extremely good coaching and training relationship,” he said. “I’m sure he will be weighing all that up but dependent upon the answer Mo gives. We have to be very sure that the testimony that has been given stands scrutiny.”'], 'targetCaptions': ['Alberto Salazar']}\n",
